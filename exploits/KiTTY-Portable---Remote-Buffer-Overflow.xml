When sending a long string to the KiTTY chat server as nickname, a crash occurs. The EIP overwrite does let little room
for exploitation (offset 54) with no more than 160 to 196 bytes for the shellcode from XP to Windows10. Using a Metasploit 
small shellcode such as windows/shell/reverse_ord_tcp (118 bytes encoded) makes KiTTY crashing after the first connection. 
We control the SEH overflow, but as all DLLs are SafeSEH protected, using an address from KiTTY itself has a NULL which 
forces us to jump backward with no extra space. We are jailed in a tight environment with little room to work with.</Information><Targets>Windows 7</Targets></Module>
